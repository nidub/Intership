      "\n",
      "This one sentence taught me the difference between being wealthy and being rich. A doctor, lawyer, or engineer can make tons of money, but they are making money trading their time. Time is a limited commodity; it becomes harder to build wealth because you can’t work 24x7. That’s when leverage comes into the picture. In his own words — “Forget rich versus poor, white-collar versus blue. It’s now leveraged versus un-leveraged.”\n",

      "\n",
      "You can have people working for you, hold equity in a business that makes money while you’re sleeping, or make money by investing it in stocks, funds, and bonds. The latest type of leverage is content creation and media.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
